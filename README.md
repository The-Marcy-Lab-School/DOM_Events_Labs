# Unit 5 Problem Set: The Document Object Model

### Directions
1. Fork and clone this lab

**For Short Responses:**

1. Write your responses directly in the `short-response.md` file. **Be sure to format your responses and code snippets correctly using Markdown.** As you commit and push changes, you will see your rendered markdown on GitHub.

2. When you are done with both sections. Push your final commits and open a PR.

**For Coding Exercises:**

1. Navigate to the `exercises` directory to complete the coding exercises.
2. There are two questions (part-1 and part-2)
3. Skeleton HTML files and empty JavaScript files have been created for you. It is your job to write code that meets the problem requirements listed in the `exercises` README.

   **Note:** You are not done with your exercises until there are no eslint errors.


### Tips
* This is open book, open note, open documentation, open console. Use your resources. Just don't use your neighbor. ðŸ˜‰
* Pay close attention to your spelling and grammar. For short responses, if you want to take advantage of spell check, etc., you can always type in a word document first and then copy your responses over.
* I'm looking for clarity and conciseness. Answer the questions as directly as you possibly can, in as few words as you possibly can, while using as precise of language as you possibly can.
* Lastly, I'm on Slack if you have any questions. ðŸ¤“
