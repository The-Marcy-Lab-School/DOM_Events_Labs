### Directions

**For Short Responses:**

**For Coding Exercises:**

1. Navigate to the `exercises` directory to complete the coding exercises.
2. There are two questions (part-1 and part-2)
3. Skeleton HTML files and empty JavaScript files have been created for you. It is your job to write code that meets the problem requirements listed in the `exercises` README.
